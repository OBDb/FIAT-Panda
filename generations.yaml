generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Type 141)"
    start_year: 1980
    end_year: 2003
    description: "The original Fiat Panda was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro as a simple, functional, and affordable small car. Featuring a distinctive boxy design with flat glass panels, it exemplified 'form follows function' with a minimalist approach. The interior was equally basic with a hammock-style rear seat, flat surfaces, and simple instruments. Initial engines included a 652cc air-cooled two-cylinder and a 903cc water-cooled four-cylinder. The Panda 4×4, introduced in 1983, was one of the first small cars to offer four-wheel drive. This generation saw numerous updates during its 23-year production run, including the introduction of the 'FIRE' engines, improved safety features, and modernized styling in the 1986 facelift. Despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, the first Panda achieved iconic status, selling over 4.5 million units and becoming a symbol of practical Italian motoring."

  - name: "Second Generation (Type 169)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The second-generation Panda represented a comprehensive modernization while maintaining the practical, space-efficient philosophy of its predecessor. The exterior featured a more rounded design with distinctive 'squircle' (squared circle) motifs that would become a Panda design signature. Significantly larger and safer than the original, it offered genuine four-adult accommodation despite compact external dimensions. Engine options included 1.1L and 1.2L petrol units and a 1.3L MultiJet diesel. The Panda 4×4 continued, offering impressive off-road capability for its size class. The interior was innovative with flexible seating arrangements and numerous storage solutions. This generation was highly successful, receiving the European Car of the Year award for 2004 and establishing new standards for small car design and functionality."

  - name: "Third Generation (Type 312)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Panda built upon its predecessor's strengths while offering improved quality, technology, and safety. Slightly larger with a more evolved design, it maintained the 'squircle' theme throughout the interior and exterior. Engine options have included the innovative two-cylinder TwinAir turbocharged engine, conventional 1.2L four-cylinder petrol units, and 1.3L MultiJet diesels. The Panda 4×4 continued as the world's smallest off-roader with genuine capability thanks to its lightweight, electronic differential locks, and specialized traction systems. Special variants have included the Cross with enhanced off-road styling and capability, the Hybrid with mild-hybrid technology, and the City Cross offering crossover styling with two-wheel drive. The interior focuses on practicality with flexible seating, numerous storage compartments, and modern connectivity options. Despite its age, the third-generation Panda remains popular for its combination of city-friendly dimensions, practical design, and unique character, continuing as one of Fiat's core models with over 7.5 million Pandas produced across all generations."
